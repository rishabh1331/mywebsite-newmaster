At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted. 

The objective of the analysis is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor. 

## Loading the data


```{r load_omega_data}
#We inform R where to read the file.
omega <- read_csv(here::here("data", "omega.csv"))

#We want to look at the data set.
glimpse(omega)
```

## Relationship Salary - Gender ?

The data frame `omega`  contains the salaries for the sample of 50 executives in the company. Can we conclude that there is a significant difference between the salaries of the male and female executives?

Note that we will perform different types of analyses, and check whether they all lead to the same conclusion 

.	Confidence intervals
.	Hypothesis testing
.	Correlation analysis
.	Regression


We will calculate summary statistics on salary by gender. Also, we will create and print a dataframe where, for each gender, we show the mean, SD, sample size, the t-critical, the SE, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95% condifence interval.

```{r, confint_single_valiables}
# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
mosaic::favstats (salary ~ gender, data=omega)

# Dataframe with two rows (male, female) and having as columns gender, mean, SD, sample size.
CI_gender <- omega %>%
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(mean_salary = mean(salary),
            sd_salary = sd(salary),
            count = n(),
            se_salary = sd_salary/sqrt(count),
            
            #the t-critical value, the standard error, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95%                 confidence interval
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), 
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_salary,
            lower = mean_salary - t_critical * se_salary,
            upper = mean_salary + t_critical * se_salary
            ) 
CI_gender

```

> From the analysis, there is an observed difference of about $8696 (73239-64543) between the mean salary for female and male, and the 95% confidence interval for the mean salary of male and female does not overlap. Based on the statistics, we can conclude that we are 95% confident that the mean salary of male is not the same as the mean salary of female.

Next, we run a hypothesis test, with: 
*H0: Mean salary difference between male and female equals zero*
*H1: Mean salary difference between male and female does not equal zero*

We run the hypothesis test using `t.test()` and with the simulation method from the `infer` package.

```{r, hypothesis_testing_gender}

# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(salary ~ gender, data = omega)


# hypothesis testing using infer package
salary_diff <- omega %>%
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("male", "female"))

null_dist_salary <- omega %>%
  specify(salary ~ gender) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("male", "female"))

ggplot(data = null_dist_salary, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()

null_dist_salary %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = salary_diff, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist_salary %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = salary_diff, direction = "two_sided")

```

> Based on the hypothesis testing, we get a p-value that is lower than the confidence level of 5%. Therefore, we rejected the null hypothesis and conclude that the difference in mean salary between male and female is not equal to zero. 

## Relationship Experience - Gender?

At the board meeting, someone raised the issue that there was indeed a substantial difference between male and female salaries, but that this was attributable to other reasons such as differences in experience. A questionnaire send out to the 50 executives in the sample reveals that the average experience of the men is approximately 21 years, whereas the women only have about 7 years experience on average (see table below).

```{r, experience_stats}

# Summary Statistics of salary by gender
favstats (experience ~ gender, data=omega)

# Dataframe with two rows (male-female) and having as columns gender, mean, SD, sample size, 
CI_experience <- omega %>%
  group_by(gender) %>% 
  summarise(mean_exp = mean(experience),
            sd_exp = sd(experience),
            count = n(),
            se_exp = sd_exp/sqrt(count),
            
            # the t-critical value, the standard error, the margin of error, and the low/high endpoints of a 95%                 confidence interval
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count-1), 
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_exp,
            lower = mean_exp - t_critical * se_exp,
            upper = mean_exp + t_critical * se_exp
            ) 
CI_experience

```

Next, we run a hypothesis test, with: 
*H0: Mean years of experience difference between male and female equals zero*
*H1: Mean years of experience difference between male and female does not equal zero*

We run the hypothesis testing using `t.test()` and with the simulation method from the `infer` package.

```{r, hypothesis_testing_experience}
# hypothesis testing using t.test() 
t.test(experience ~ gender, data = omega)


# hypothesis testing using infer package
exp_diff <- omega %>%
  specify(experience ~ gender) %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("male", "female"))

null_dist_exp <- omega %>%
  specify(experience ~ gender) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("male", "female"))

ggplot(data = null_dist_exp, aes(x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()

null_dist_exp %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = exp_diff, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist_exp %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = exp_diff, direction = "two_sided")

```
> Based on the hypothesis testing, we get a p-value that is lower than the confidence level of 5%. Therefore, we rejected the null hypothesis and conclude that the difference in mean experience between male and female is not equal to zero. This conclusion will endganger the conclusion about the difference in male and female salaries, indicating that there might be other variables that contribute to the difference in salary other than sex.


## Relationship Salary - Experience ?

Someone at the meeting argues that clearly, a more thorough analysis of the relationship between salary and experience is required before any conclusion can be drawn about whether there is any gender-based salary discrimination in the company.

To analyse the relationship between salary and experience, we draw a scatterplot to visually inspect the data


```{r, salary_exp_scatter}

#Scatter plot to show relationship between salary and experience.
omega %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=experience, y=salary))+
  
  #make it a scatter plot
  geom_point()+

  #bring in a line of best fit
  geom_smooth(method = lm)+
  
  #make it pretty
  theme_minimal()+
  labs(title = "Experience is a good indicator of salary",
       subtitle = "Scatter plot to show correlation",
       x = "Years of Experience",
       y = "Salary")



```


## Check correlations between the data
We use `GGally:ggpairs()` to create a scatterplot and correlation matrix. Essentially, we change the order our variables will appear in and have the dependent variable (Y), salary, as last in our list. We then pipe the dataframe to `ggpairs()` with `aes` arguments to color by `gender` and make these plots somewhat transparent (`alpha  = 0.3`).

```{r, ggpairs}

omega %>% 
  select(gender, experience, salary) %>% #order variables they will appear in ggpairs()
  ggpairs(aes(colour=gender, alpha = 0.3))+
  theme_bw()

```

> The plot illustrates the relationship between experience and salary. The scatterplot as well as the correlation of 0.803 shows a strong and positive relationship between salary and experience. This correlation is higher for female, with a correlation of 0.812, and smaller for male, with a correlation of 0.661. Since the mean experience for male is higher than the mean experience for female, the mean salary for male is also higher than the mean salary for female.
