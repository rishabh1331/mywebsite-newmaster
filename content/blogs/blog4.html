<p>At the last board meeting of Omega Group Plc., the headquarters of a large multinational company, the issue was raised that women were being discriminated in the company, in the sense that the salaries were not the same for male and female executives. A quick analysis of a sample of 50 employees (of which 24 men and 26 women) revealed that the average salary for men was about 8,700 higher than for women. This seemed like a considerable difference, so it was decided that a further analysis of the company salaries was warranted.</p>
<p>The objective of the analysis is to find out whether there is indeed a significant difference between the salaries of men and women, and whether the difference is due to discrimination or whether it is based on another, possibly valid, determining factor.</p>

<h2>Relationship Salary - Experience ?</h2>

<p>The plot illustrates the relationship between experience and salary. The scatterplot as well as the correlation of 0.803 shows a strong and positive relationship between salary and experience. This correlation is higher for female, with a correlation of 0.812, and smaller for male, with a correlation of 0.661. Since the mean experience for male is higher than the mean experience for female, the mean salary for male is also higher than the mean salary for female.</p>
