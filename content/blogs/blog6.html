title: Who am I?
---



<p>I was born in the United States in January 1999, more precisely in Livingston New Jersey. During my childhood I grew up between Paris (France) and Princeton (New Jersey). I am reading for the Masters in Financial Analysis degree at London Business School and wish to undertake a career in finance, and more specifically in either Global Capital Markets or in Global Advisory.</p>
<p>Thanks to my multicultural background I was, and still is, always interested in learning new approaches and adopting several points of view. As far as I can remember, I always was very interested in quantitative topics, and when I grew I started to develop interpersonal and leadership skills whilst pursuing my passion for numbers and mathematical puzzles.</p>
<p>Outside of the academic and professional framework, I love playing soccer/football (I do not know where you are reading this from) and chess, I am also an avid swimmer. When COVID will be more under control, I would gladly start attending theatrical plays once again, my personal favorites are the ones of the classical era.</p>
<p>Here below is my CV, and feel free to reach out:</p>
